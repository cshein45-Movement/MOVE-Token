TICKET-1101,"🎫 Support Ticket – Website Performance Degradation

Priority: High
Project: Movement DAO
Submitted by: KoKyat / DAO Core Contributor

⸻

🐞 Issue Description

We’re experiencing significant website performance degradation affecting the Movement DAO platform. Page load times have increased, and user interaction latency is disrupting community engagement and on-chain proposal visibility.

📌 Scope of Issue
	•	Load latency on key pages (governance dashboard, proposal viewer)
	•	Timeout errors on Snapshot or Reown-linked dashboards
	•	Smart contract interaction (claim, vote) UIs lagging
	•	Reduced responsiveness on both desktop and mobile

🔍 Suspected Causes
	•	Possible hosting server strain or CDN misconfiguration
	•	Uncompressed media files or excessive plugin load
	•	High-frequency token activity or on-chain calls creating UI slowdowns

⸻

🧾 Additional Context
	•	Project: Movement DAO (linked with KoKyat, founder)
	•	Token: MOVE Token
	•	Web3 Integrations: Snapshot, Reown, Streaming Contracts
	•	On-chain activity has recently increased due to proposals and claim streams.

⸻

✅ Desired Outcome
	•	Performance audit of the platform
	•	Optimization recommendations (asset compression, script deferral, cache/CDN checks)
	•	Confirmation that user wallets and DAO actions are unaffected",Open,High,06-16-2025
